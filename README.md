# CodeSemanticSearch
A semantic search engine that retrieves code. Uses data from the CodeSearchNet challenge.


**Note**: The document embeddings file is too large to put on GitHub, so you will have to run step 3a and skip step 3b the first time you run the code in order to generate the embeddings. For every time afterwards, you can skip step 3a and proceed to step 3b.
